run-tests CONFIG

  CONFIG - Path to the protractor configuration file.

  If the protractor configuration file includes the sauceKey and sauceUser properties, a sauce-labs
  virtual testing environment is used.  You may also enable a sauce-connect proxy by specifying
  proxy: true.

  In the absence of these properties a local selenium server is started.
